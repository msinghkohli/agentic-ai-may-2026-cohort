# Project 3: Ledger Lockdown - An Invoice-to-Payment Approval 

> 40-minute group activity: take a working-but-naive multi-agent invoice-approval system and refine it for production.

## How It Works

| Phase | Duration | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| **Refine the system** | 40 minutes | Your group hardens the given baseline along the 4 dimensions below |
| **Present** | 10 minutes | Walk the cohort through your refined design and the tradeoffs you made |

You are given a problem statement and a working-but-naive baseline implementation. Your job is not to redesign from zero. It is to make it production-ready.

### a) Problem Statement

A mid-market company's Accounts Payable team gets about 4,000 vendor invoices a month, arriving as PDFs and email attachments. The layouts vary, currencies differ, some are scanned images, and some carry embedded "remit-to" instructions. Today, AP clerks key in the fields by hand, cross-check each invoice against the matching Purchase Order and Goods Receipt (the 3-way match), watch for duplicate billing and bank-detail-change fraud, and route exceptions. It's slow (about 9 days to approve on average), error-prone, and a known fraud surface: business email compromise, inflated quantities, invoices split just under approval thresholds.

**The question this agent answers:** *"For this incoming invoice, should we PAY, HOLD, or ESCALATE, and what's the evidence?"* The system has to output a structured decision with line-item match results, exceptions, a risk score, and a citation trail an auditor can replay step by step.

### b) The Baseline You're Given (deliberately naive)

A fixed sequential pipeline. Every invoice flows through all agents in the same order, one at a time, regardless of type or risk, and one big LLM does every step.

| Agent | Single responsibility | Tool(s) |
|---|---|---|
| **Extractor Agent** | OCR + parse the invoice into structured fields (vendor, totals, line items, remit-to bank details) | OCR / Document MCP, LLM extraction |
| **Matcher Agent** | Perform the 3-way match against POs and Goods Receipts | ERP API (POs, receipts), SQL MCP |
| **Compliance Agent** | Check tax validity, sanctions/OFAC list, duplicate-invoice detection | Vector DB (historical invoices), sanctions API |
| **Risk Agent** | Score fraud likelihood (bank-detail change, threshold-splitting, anomalous amounts) | Vector DB, rules lookup |
| **Decision Agent** | Synthesize everything into PAY / HOLD / ESCALATE + rationale | LLM, writes to audit log |

```

  * every invoice takes the full 5-hop path, serially
  * one big LLM does OCR cleanup AND high-stakes fraud reasoning alike
  * no router, no parallelism, no clean-invoice fast-path, no human-in-loop gate
```

> The baseline is functional. Your job is to identify where it falls short and make it production-ready.

### c) Your Task: Refine on 4 Dimensions

**1. Multi-agent pattern**
Every invoice takes the same 5-hop path no matter its type, value, or risk level. Is that the right design? How would you restructure the topology, and what tradeoffs come with adding complexity to a system that touches real payments?

**2. Evaluation**
AP errors run in two directions: approving invoices you shouldn't, and holding invoices you should pay. How do you measure the system across both failure modes? Which one is more expensive, and how should that shape your evaluation priorities?

**3. LLM strategy**
One large model handles both OCR cleanup and high-stakes fraud reasoning. How would you decide where to use what, and how would you actually validate that choice instead of just assuming a bigger model is always better?

**4. Security**
The invoice PDFs are documents an attacker controls. What could a malicious vendor embed in one, and where would that payload land in your pipeline? What other trust boundaries exist in a system that writes to an audit log and queues payments?

### d) Time Limit

40 minutes to refine, 10 minutes to present.

## Presentation Format (10 minutes)

1. **The refined agent map**: what you changed and why
2. **Your eval plan**: the metric that matters most, and how you'd measure it
3. **Your LLM strategy**: how you'd allocate models across the pipeline and handle provider unavailability
4. **Your top security risk**: and how you'd defend against it

> **Bonus discussion:** Where do you set the confidence threshold to auto-approve versus defer to a human? What happens when the LLM gets it wrong and an AP clerk overrides the decision? How does that feed back into the system?
