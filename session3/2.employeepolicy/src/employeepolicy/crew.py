# Use the configuration below instead when reranking is desired in RAG.
#
# Reranking improves retrieval quality by having a second model score each retrieved chunk
# against the query and reorder results by relevance. This means you can cast a wide net
# (numberOfResults: 20) with the initial vector search, then let the reranker surface only
# the most relevant chunks (numberOfRerankedResults: 5) before they reach the LLM — reducing
# token usage and improving answer accuracy.
#
# Amazon Bedrock supports two reranking models (docs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/rerank-supported.html):
#   - amazon.rerank-v1:0       (not available in us-east-1)
#   - cohere.rerank-v3-5:0     (available in us-east-1, us-west-2, eu-central-1, ap-northeast-1, ca-central-1)
